## Schedule  {-}

**Thursday, June 30, 2022**

- Optional day trips for hikes to mountaintops or waterfalls, Greenville zoo and playground, and tours of falls park downtown Greenville
- Optional group dinner at hotel
- Cousin's nightout

As we get closer to this date, we may try to get a rough headcount for dinner, and then we will reserve a meeting room at either a local barbecue or seafood restaurant. More details to come!

**Friday, July 1, 2022** 

- LEISURELY Breakfast at the hotel
- Lake day on Lake Hartwell 10 AM to 4 PM
- Optional Group dinner, location TBD

We have a herd of kid and adult size lifejackets, **but if you have access to lifejackets, please bring them.** We would like for everyone to wear them. **The lake will be very, very busy this weekend** – this will be the busiest day of the year at the lake. Also, don't where I really nice bathing suit, as all the boats on the lake will kick up the mud and give a nice permanent orange tint whatever you wear!

The group dinner on this evening will likely be very very casual and probably at the hotel, as we imagine people will be straggling back from the lake and other daily activities at random times. Some may even be tired!


**Saturday, July 2, 2022**

- Official Turner reunion 10 AM until noon at Hotel
- Lunch at Hotel noon until 1:30 PM
- Pool time at hotel 1:30 until ....

More details will, on the actual reunion day activities, but we will definitely incorporate some of the standards you expect:

Please be thinking about who in your family would like to give an extended family update – we would like to have one speaker represent the families of Chris, John, Lawrence, Jenny, Mickey, Bill, Yvonne, Jim, Wayne, and Bobby.

In the mandatory family photo session will be in full effect!

There will also be a little bit of music, a game or two, and a lots of eating!

After the official reunion, our hope is that everyone hangs out at the pool and/or the air-conditioned meeting rooms for most of the rest of the day.
