## Schedule  {-}

**Thursday, June 30, 2022**

- LEISURELY Breakfast at the hotel
- Optional day trips for hikes to mountaintops or waterfalls, Greenville Zoo and playground, and tours of Falls Park, and  downtown Greenville
- Optional group dinner, location TBD
- Cousin's night out

As we get closer to this date, we may try to get a rough headcount for dinner.  Then we will reserve a meeting room at either a local barbecue or seafood restaurant. More details to come!

**Friday, July 1, 2022** 

- LEISURELY Breakfast at the hotel
- Lake day on Lake Hartwell 10 AM to 4 PM (Fun fact: you have the chance to sit where the photo below was taken!)
- Dinner on your own 

We have several kid and adult size lifejackets to share, **but if you have access to lifejackets, please bring them.** We would like for everyone to wear them. **The lake will be very, very busy this weekend** â€“ the busiest of the year. Also, don't wear a really nice bathing suit, as all the boats on the lake will kick up mud and give a nice permanent orange tint to whatever you wear!

We will also have hotdogs, watermelon and chips for lunch at the lake.

There is not a planned dinner for this evening.  We imagine people will be straggling back from the lake and other daily activities at random times. Some may even be tired!  I am sure there will be people hanging out at the hotel pool for those inclined.


**Saturday, July 2, 2022**

- LEISURELY Breakfast at the hotel
- Official Turner reunion 10 AM until noon at Hotel
- Lunch at Hotel noon until 1:30 PM
- Pool time at hotel 1:30 until ....

More details will follow on the actual reunion day activities.  We will definitely incorporate some of the standards you expect.

Please be thinking about who in your family would like to give an extended family update.  We would like to have one speaker represent the families of Chris, John, Lawrence, Jenny, Mickey, Bill, Yvonne, Jim, Wayne, and Bobby.

The **mandatory** family photo session will be in full effect!

There will also be a little bit of music, a game or two, and lots of eating!

After the official reunion, our hope is that everyone hangs out at the pool and/or the air-conditioned meeting rooms for most of the rest of the day.
